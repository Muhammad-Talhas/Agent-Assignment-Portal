# Agent-Assignment-Portal
This repository contains my submissions for the Agentic AI Assignments, built using the OpenAI Agent SDK and Chainlit. Each assignment demonstrates the creation of intelligent agents capable of reasoning, tool usage, and interacting in natural language.  ✅ Assignments Included: Basic FAQ Agent – Answers predefined questions using a static knowledge base.  Math Function Tool Agent – Performs basic math operations using a custom function tool.  Weather Info Agent (Tool Calling) – Retrieves live weather data using an external API.  Agent with Multiple Tools – Combines multiple tools (e.g., math, weather, conversion) into a single intelligent agent
